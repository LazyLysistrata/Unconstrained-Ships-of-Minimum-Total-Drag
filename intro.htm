<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
Consider first a class of monohull ships moving steadily ahead on a flat
calm infinitely-deep sea. Fix the displacement, draft, speed, and hull
shape. The length is then essentially the only variable allowed. At any
given length, adjust the beam by uniform scaling of all offsets, so as to
achieve the prescribed displacement; longer ships are thinner. Now vary
the length until the total (viscous plus wave) drag
R<SUB>t</SUB>=R<SUB>v</SUB>+R<SUB>w</SUB> is minimised.
<p>
The above simplified ship optimisation problem, with length as the only
variable, usually possesses a non-trivial solution, i.e. a finite optimum
length, for the following reason. Viscous drag R<SUB>v</SUB> is
predominantly skin friction, which is proportional to surface area, and as
a body of a given volume gets longer and thinner, its surface area
increases. Hence viscous drag increases with length at fixed displacement.
<p>
On the other hand, for conventional ships at conventional speeds, wave
resistance R<SUB>w</SUB> generally decreases as the ship length
increases. Since we are holding the speed U fixed, as we increase the
length L, we are decreasing the length-based Froude number
F=U/sqrt(gL). At fixed displacement, and at most relatively low Froude
numbers, wave resistance is a (rapidly) increasing function of Froude
number, and therefore decreases with increasing length. There are wobbles
in the graph of wave resistance versus Froude number, so this is not an
absolute conclusion, but it does hold in most cases, and of course this
advantage of long ships is very much part of the naval architectural art.
<p>
Since there are opposite trends with length in the two constituents of the
total drag, there must be a minimum for their sum, at some non-trivial
intermediate length. That length is generally somewhat larger than for
conventional ships.
<p>
In fact, sometimes there is more than one local minimum in the graph of
total drag versus length, and this phenomenon is discussed in more detail
in the following section. There is often a delicate interplay between local
and global optima, which makes for an optimisation process that is quite
difficult to analyse. In order to deal with this problem, we use here a
powerful general purpose technique, described later, called &quot;genetic
algorithms&quot;.
<p>
In the present paper, we perform an exhaustive treatment of this
optimisation problem for a family of monohull and multihull vessels,
covering a very large range of speeds and displacements. We hold the hull
shape, displacement and speed fixed, and allow the draft (and for
multihulls, various other parameters) as well as the length to vary
until the minimum total drag is achieved. We treat viscous drag as the
sum of skin friction (estimated by the 1957 ITTC line) and a generally
small but sometimes crucial form drag contribution which is estimated
by an empirical formula. We use Michell's integral for the wave
resistance, which is only accurate for thin ships. However, this is a
more than usually good assumption for the class of extremely fine
hulls that arise from this optimisation process.
<p>
When we treat multihull vessels, each separate hull is taken from the
same shape family as the monohulls. For catamarans consisting of two
identical side-by-side hulls, there is thus just one further parameter
that participates in the optimisation, namely the lateral hull
separation distance. There are some speed ranges where there is an
optimal finite choice for this separation, and others where the best
separation is infinite - that is, the optimum &quot;catamaran&quot; is
actually two unconnected hulls. We find that, from the point of view of
total drag (with no length restriction), a catamaran can never compete
with a length-optimised monohull of the same total displacement. This is
essentially because of the increased wetted surface area created by
splitting the hull in two, which increases further the already dominant
viscous drag component.
<p>
As the number of hulls increases, many more parameters are involved in
the optimisation of multihull vessels, even within the constraint that
all hulls have the same shape. For example, for laterally-symmetric
trimarans there are a total of seven parameters; namely two drafts,
two lengths, one ratio between side-hull and total displacement, one
longitudinal and one lateral separation distance. The side-hull
displacement ratio parameter is somewhat special, in that the trimaran
reduces to a monohull when this ratio is near zero and to a catamaran
when it is near unity. If that parameter is included in the optimisation
process, a monohull results automatically whenever a length-optimised
monohull is superior to a trimaran (which is always!), and similarly a
catamaran would result if a catamaran was superior to a trimaran. Hence
in order to confine attention to true trimarans, we use only a 6-parameter
optimisation, then repeating this optimisation for a range of values of
the displacement ratio. The results show that (strictly from the
total-resistance point of view of the present paper) trimarans are
also uncompetitive with length-optimised monohulls or catamarans.
<p>
When there are length (or other) restrictions, and hence (for
shorter-than-optimal ships) a greater contribution of wave resistance to
the total drag, multihulls can have less total drag than monohulls of the
same length, because of the potential for favourable hull-hull
cancellation of wave resistance. For example, in work to be reported
elsewhere, we have examined a 3500 tonne vessel of length 160m designed
to operate at 40 knots speed. In that case, the best catamaran has 10%
less total drag than the best monohull of the same length, and there are
indications that further improvements are possible with optimised
trimarans.
<p>
The main purpose of the present study is to provide a benchmark, from
which extended studies can follow. One class of such extensions
obviously involves allowing the shape of the hull to vary. For the
present study, we have used a very fine type of hull, appropriate for
high-speed and sporting-type vessels, and there is a need to repeat the
study with more commercial shapes of hull.
<p>
However, perhaps of greater importance is inclusion of further
constraints. When the only quantities held fixed are speed and
displacement, it is not surprising that the resulting ship proportions
are somewhat (but not outrageously) unconventional. Further constraints,
such as constraints on maximum length or minimum beam, arise inevitably
from commercial, structural, safety, seakeeping, or sporting
requirements. When these constraints are imposed, the ship proportions
will return to the more conventional range, but at a price in terms of
increased total drag. It is of value to know just how much of a price
is being paid.
<p>
<h3>1.1 An illustrative example</h3>
In the present section, we first give an example illustrating the
character of the results obtained in the present study. Further results
are presented in more generality and in nondimensional form later. For
this example, we confine attention to a &quot;ship&quot; of one-tonne
displacement, representative of a (large) rowing shell, and use
dimensional units.

Figure 1.1 shows two typical examples of graphs of total drag versus
length (in metres) at a fixed speed, for such a vessel. For the present
purpose, it is not essential how the drag is determined or scaled, but
we should note that it does include an allowance for form drag, discussed
later. The blue curve is at a fixed speed of 5.56 knots and the red
curve at only a very slightly higher speed of 5.59 knots. In both cases,
there are two prominent minima, i.e. two distinct (and remarkably
different) lengths are locally favourable, and define &quot;best&quot; and
&quot;second-best&quot; ships. At the lower speed, the longer ship (13.2
metres length) is better than the shorter ship (9.8m), whereas at the
higher speed, the shorter ship (9.6m) is superior to the longer ship
(12.3m). Thus, as we vary the speed and other parameters, there may occur
an interchange between two local optima, so that the optimum length may
appear to change discontinuously. These changes can occur over a
remarkably narrow range of speeds.

<p>
This type of discontinuity in the optimum length is shown in Figure
1.2, again taken from the family of one-tonne monohulls. This figure
gives the optimum length in metres as a function of the speed in knots.
The discontinuities indicated above occur only at relatively low speeds,
notably at about 5.6 knots (where the change between the two curves of
Figure 1.1 occurs) and 4.3 knots, with smaller discontinuities at even
lower speeds.
<p>
At speeds between the discontinuities, the Froude number based on
shiplength remains essentially constant, and examination of the
variation of wave resistance with Froude number indicates that this
constant value corresponds to a local minimum of wave resistance.
What is happening as we increase the speed is that, in attempting to
design for minimum total drag, we simultaneously increase the shiplength,
in order to stay at that local minimum. This continues as long as
possible while we increase the speed, and when it is no longer possible,
the optimum ship suddenly decreases its length, so that the Froude number
suddenly jumps to the next higher local minimum, avoiding the local
maximum in between. This process is intuitively like changing gears!
<p>
The length variation in the example of Figure 1.2 is continuous for all
speeds above 5.6 knots. However, as is discussed later, if form drag is
neglected, there can also be an apparent high-speed discontinuity. It is
important to note that, as indicated by Figure 1.1, there is no
discontinuity in the actual total drag at these speeds, merely an
interchange in the roles of &quot;best&quot; and &quot;second-best&quot;
ships. At the speeds where the optimum length changes discontinuously, the
residual total drag tends to reach a local maximum, where its rate of
change with respect to speed changes discontinuously.
<p>
Although these discontinuities are of interest in their own right, they
are not necessarily the most important feature of Figure 1.2. They depend
on the fact that the wave resistance possesses minima, and these minima
are to a certain extent magnified by the theoretical procedure (here
Michell's integral) used to compute wave resistance. If more empirical
means are used to estimate wave resistance, with the effect of smoothing
out the humps and hollows in the wave resistance variation, there will be
a consequent reduction in the size of the discontinuities. However, so long
as there are at least two minima in the wave resistance curve, a
discontinuity is inevitable, no matter what method is used to estimate
wave resistance.
<p>
Above 5.6 knots, the optimum length of a one-tonne vessel varies smoothly,
and it is unlikely that the optimum length is sensitive to the procedure
for wave resistance computation. In fact, the range of speeds above that
where discontinuous length changes occur is the one of greatest interest in
practice; for example, it is the competitive speed range for rowing shells.
