<h2>4. RESULTS</h2>

<h3>4.1 Method of presentation</h3>

Since there is no length restriction, but the displacement D
is fixed, the appropriate length parameter for scaling is the cube root
L<sup>*</sup>=D<sup>1/3</sup> of the displacement. Results are presented in a
non-dimensional manner as a function of the (volumetric) Froude number
F<sub>nv</sub>=U/sqrt(gL<sup>*</sup>) based on that artificial length. In fact, were it
not for scale (Reynolds number) effects, all results would be universal
functions of this Froude number, and displacement would be irrelevant. For
example, the final minimum total drag
R<sub>t</sub>=R<sub>v</sub>+R<sub>w</sub> is expressed in terms of the
coefficient
<p>
C<sub>t</sub>=R<sub>t</sub>/(1/2*rho*U<sup>2</sup>L<sup>*2</sup>)
<p>
which would be a function of F<sub>nv</sub> alone were it not for the fact that the
skin friction coefficient depends on Reynolds number.
<p>
In order to exhibit this scale effect of displacement, we carry out the
optimisation at three fixed (dimensional) displacements of one, one
hundred, and ten thousand tonnes. This large range of displacements means
that in some cases the speeds are not realistic, but results are
nevertheless provided for completeness in such cases. In fact we have also
computed results for even larger vessels, up to one million tonnes.
<p>
For definiteness, we give most results for the fixed displacement of one
tonne. Some such results have already been given in Figures 1.1 and 1.2.
It is notable that for this displacement, L<sup>*</sup>=1 metre, so that the
non-dimensional length can also be interpreted as the actual length in
metres. The volumetric Froude number is also uniquely proportional to the
actual speed in metres/second or knots, and F<sub>nv</sub>=1 occurs at 6.1 knots
for a one-tonne vessel.
<p>
It is important to bear in mind that none of the Figures 2-4 to follow,
where the total drag coefficient C<sub>t</sub> is plotted against the
volumetric Froude number F<sub>nv</sub>, can be interpreted in the usual naval
architectural manner as a graph of drag versus speed for a <i>given</i>
ship. As F<sub>nv</sub> varies, the ship itself changes its shape, and in
particular its length, so as to keep the drag as small as possible.

The dashed curve of Fig. 2(a) shows C<sub>t</sub> as a function of
volumetric Froude number F<sub>nv</sub>, for a one-tonne &quot;ship&quot;. This
is the residual value of the total drag, after the ship's dimensions have
been optimised to minimise C<sub>t</sub> without any allowance being made
for form drag. The hull parameters that produce these optimal
C<sub>t</sub>'s are shown as the dashed curves in Figures 2(c)-2(e).

</table>
</center>
<p>
Fig. 2(b) shows wave resistance as a fraction of the total drag.
There is considerable scatter at low F<sub>nv</sub>. This could be due to long
shallow regions in the &quot;fitness&quot; landscape, where for example,
one length is as good as another.  Although C<sub>t</sub> remains the
same, C<sub>w</sub>/C<sub>t</sub> may vary. GODZILLA searches for the
lowest total resistance and if it encounters two or more combinations
of parameters with almost the same C<sub>t</sub>, it cannot prefer one to
the other. In these regions, it could be important to perform the
integrations more accurately. In any case, wave resistance is less than
12% of the total for all F<sub>nv</sub>&lt;3.25.
<p>
The most obvious feature of the dashed curve in Figure 2(b), however, is
the sudden increase in the proportion of wave resistance for F<sub>nv</sub>&gt;3.25,
a rather high speed (of the order of 20 knots for a 1-tonne vessel) near
the upper end of the range being considered in this study. Figure 2(c)
shows that the optimum (non-dimensional) length also drops sharply to a
very low level at this speed. This discontinuity is essentially an
interchange in the roles of two local minima, as in Figure 1.1. For
F<sub>nv</sub>&lt;3.25, the longer ship is best; for F<sub>nv</sub>&gt;3.25 the shorter ship
is best, and in the present case, the shorter ship is so short as to be
quite unrealistic. Indeed, this &quot;ship&quot; almost eliminates its
wave resistance by going to a very high rather than a very low
conventional Froude number. Minimum viscous drag dictates minimum
surface area, and that inevitably pushes the optimum toward a
hemispherical geometry. In the present case, other constraints prevent
this hemisphere being achieved exactly, but this class of
&quot;optimum&quot; ship does tend to have length comparable to the
beam and draft. Clearly this is not a realistic conclusion, and in
particular would lead us to question the validity of neglecting form drag.

<p>
</center>
<p>
Returning to the &quot;realistic&quot; ships produced for lower speeds,
with F<sub>nv</sub>&lt;3.25, as the &quot;design speed&quot; increases from zero in
that range, the optimum length L/L<sup>*</sup> (same as length in metres for a
one-tonne ship) shown in Figure 2(c) increases to a maximum of about
22 at a F<sub>nv</sub> value of about 1.8 before decreasing slowly as the speed
increases further. This volumetric Froude number of 1.8 corresponds to
a conventional (actual length-based) Froude number of 0.38, or a speed of
11 knots for a one-tonne vessel. At speeds below this value, the usual
very dramatic large rise in wave resistance occurs as the length-based
Froude number increases. Not surprisingly, longer ships are then
preferred as the speed rises.
<p>
This trend cannot continue for ever. Eventually, the optimal shiplength
reaches a maximum, and further increases in speed can no longer be met by
increasing length to keep operating well below the wave resistance main
peak. Instead, the length-based Froude number passes (quite rapidly)
through the value where wave resistance is maximal, but the proportion of
wave resistance is nevertheless kept sufficiently low to achieve an optimal
design because of the large shiplength. Eventually as the speed increases
further, the optimal shiplength starts to decrease again, since we are now
operating at a length-based Froude number above the main wave resistance
peak. Then the wave resistance decreases with Froude number, and hence
shorter ships have less rather than more wave resistance at any given
speed, and are preferred in the optimisation.

<p>
When the length is so great, the surface area strongly controls the
optimisation, and to minimise the increase in frictional resistance,
semi-circular sections tend to be preferred. This is clear in Figure
2(d), where it can be seen that the beam-to-draft ratio B/T stays at a
value of roughly 2 for F<sub>nv</sub> between 1.0 and 2.5.

<p>
The optimum ships are very slender. Figure 2(e) shows the length/beam
ratio, which is very high indeed (reaching a maximum of about 42 at
F<sub>nv</sub>=1.8) by conventional ship standards, though not entirely
unreasonable for rowing shells.
<p>

<h3>4.3 Monohull with form drag</h3>

Figures 2(a) - 2(e) also show (solid curves) the same monohull
calculations as in the previous section for a one-tonne ship, but here
the total resistance now includes Scragg and Nelson's (1993) form factor.
<p>
Figure 2(a) indicates that there is only a quite small increase in the
residual total drag C<sub>t</sub> for all speeds, consistent with the
fact that the form drag is small, especially for the present very fine
hulls. The greatest impact of form effects on the optimisation process
occurs at very low and very high F<sub>nv</sub>. The solid-line C<sub>t</sub>
curves of Figure 2(a) are smoother at low F<sub>nv</sub> than the dashed curves,
and the ultimate decrease in C<sub>t</sub> at high F<sub>nv</sub> is no longer
as rapid.
<p>
Figure 2(b) shows that with form drag included, the proportion of wave
resistance now remains below 10% for all speeds and all displacements.
The scatter at low F<sub>nv</sub> is not so pronounced as in the optimisations
without form effects. Most important of all, however, is that there is
no longer a sudden discontinuous increase in the proportion of wave
resistance for F<sub>nv</sub>&gt;3.25. We have already anticipated this, since the
very short ships that were suggested at high speeds by the optimisation
without form drag are now heavily penalised by their large entrance and
exit angles, and fail in total drag competition with a local minimum
corresponding to a longer ship.
<p>
Figure 2(c) confirms this point, indicating that the optimum ship stays
&quot;long&quot; for all speeds, with no discontinuity at any high-end
speed. Indeed, with the inclusion of form effects, there is a tendency
towards slightly longer optimum ships. The beam-to-draft ratios shown in
Figure 2(d) are generally about 10% smaller with form drag included.
For our canoe body, small entrance and exit angles can only be achieved
by reducing the beam, so there is a slight tendency toward non-circular
cross-sections, with B/T&lt;2.
<p>
At the intermediate speeds which are of the greatest practical interest,
there is only a small effect of the form factor on all outputs, and the
qualitative discussion in the previous section about transition through
the speeds where the wave resistance and hence the optimum length is
maximal applies equally with or without form factor.  Nevertheless,
because as we have seen, inclusion of a form factor makes for a smoother
and more realistic optimisation process at all speeds, such a factor is
included in all of the remaining computations presented here.

<p>
In Figures 3(a)-(e) and 4(a)-(c), the blue, green and red curves correspond
to displacements of 1, 100, and 10,000 tonnes respectively.
<p>
Figures 3(a)-(e) indicate variation with displacement of the same
quantities that were discussed earlier for the one-tonne ship. Note that
the proportionality constant relating actual speed to volumetric Froude
number varies as the one-sixth power of displacement. Specifically, the
actual speed at F<sub>nv</sub>=1 is 6.1 knots for a 1-tonne vessel, 13.1 knots
for a 100-tonne vessel, and 28.3 knots for a 10,000-tonne vessel.
<p>
Smaller ships have larger C<sub>t</sub> because they are shorter, their
Reynolds numbers are smaller, and consequently the skin friction
coefficient is larger. Of course the actual total drag R<sub>t</sub> is
much larger for larger ships, once we multiply C<sub>t</sub> by
1/2*rho*U<sup2</sup>*D<sup>2/3</sup>.
<p>
In the most important middle range of speeds, the dependence of the
results on displacement is quite smooth and predictable by interpolation
within the curves presented here.
<p>

<h3>4.5 Catamarans</h3>

We now give results for catamarans where the two demihulls are identical
and their centreplanes are spaced W apart. GODZILLA attempts to choose W
(as well as L and T) optimally, noting that W can only affect the wave
resistance part of the total drag. The effect on the optimisation process
of including form drag is similar for catamarans and monohulls. Hence
results are presented here for catamarans only with form drag included.
<p>
From a survey of modern high speed catamaran dimensions, Insel and Molland
(1991) concluded that the general range of parameters was: L/B=6 to 12,
L/L<sup>*</sup>=6 to 9, B/T=1.0 to 3.0 and C<sub>b</sub>=0.33 to 0.45. Our optimum
hulls are very much longer; however C<sub>b</sub> and B/T are within the
above range.

<p>
</center>
<p>
The C<sub>t</sub> curves in Figure 4(a) are similar in general character
to those for the monohull in Figure 3(a). It is obvious that there is no
speed or displacement at which a catamaran has lower total resistance than
an optimum monohull of the same displacement. The proportion of wave
resistance for optimum catamarans is generally similar to that for
optimum monohulls as given in Figure 3(b), and is always less than 10%.

   catamaran.</B></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
A comparison of the optimum length results in Figures 4(b) and 3(c)
shows that at low speeds, catamarans have an optimal length roughly the
same as the equivalent monohulls. At higher speeds around F<sub>nv</sub>=1.6
(namely 10 knots for a one-tonne vessel), where the optimal length of a
catamaran reaches its maximum a little earlier than a monohull, optimal
catamarans tend to be roughly 25% shorter than the optimal monohull of
the same displacement. Length-to-beam ratios for the demihulls of optimal
catamarans are similar to that for monohulls (Figure 2(e)) at all speeds.
For example, each demihull beam is also about 25% less than that of the
full equivalent monohull at about F<sub>nv</sub>=1.6 when L/B takes its maximum
value of about 41. That is, each demihull of an optimum catamaran is
approximately as slender as the optimum monohull, and is much more slender
than conventional catamaran hulls. Beam-to-draft ratios are also similar
to those of monohulls, and nearly semi-circular sections are preferred.

</table>
<p>
</center>
<p>
Figure 4(c) shows the optimum hull separation W/L. It can be seen that
for F<sub>nv</sub> between 0.2 and 1.1 the optimum separation is roughly 20%-30%
of the length of the catamaran. For F<sub>nv</sub> between 1.1 and 2.2 there is
no optimum finite spacing. To all intents and purposes, if one only wishes
to minimise total drag, there is no reason why the two hulls need to be
close to each other, because they cannot favourably interfere with each
other to reduce wave resistance in that speed range. Indeed, they must
interfere with each other unfavourably, and our conclusion is that the
further they are apart the better from the drag point of view. This speed
range is one of considerable practical interest, and it is one in which
the decision on choice of hull separation distance must be made on grounds
other than drag minimisation.  The existence of a speed range where there
is no best separation distance is in rough accord with the results of
Turner and Taplin (1968), wherein it was pointed out that this conclusion
tends toward catamarans that are impractically wide for all but sailing
boats.  At still higher speeds, there again seems to be a band of F<sub>nv</sub>
(say between 2.3 and 3.4) where there is an optimum finite hull separation,
again of about 20% of the length. For F<sub>nv</sub>&gt;3.4, again there is no best
separation distance.
<p>
Insel and Molland (1991) comment on some aspects of this phenomenon,
stating that &quot;The wave interference can effectively be neglected above
a particular speed which is both separation and L/B dependent. This is an
interesting and important result since it suggests that, for higher speed
designs, the choice of hull spacing may be based on other requirements such
as seakeeping performance without incurring significant penalties in calm
water resistance.&quot; However, they do not seem to have observed the
second range of speeds where destructive interference again becomes useful.
<p>

<h3>4.6 Trimarans</h3>

The trimarans of interest here consist of a main hull together with two
side hulls placed parallel to each other, with their centres at a distance
a aft of the centre of the main hull and at distances b abeam of it.
The side hulls can have different displacements, lengths and drafts from
the main hull, but otherwise have the same shape as the main hull. We
carry out a six-parameter optimisation, for each separate value of the
ratio sigma between the (sum of two) side-hull displacement and the
total (main plus two side hulls) displacement.
<p>
In order to reduce the amount of output data that has to be presented for
trimarans, we select a relatively small set of speeds (displacement-based
Froude numbers of 1.3,1.7 and 2.1), and plot results at each fixed speed
versus the above-defined displacement ratio sigma. The speeds chosen are
in the &quot;interesting&quot; range, namely speeds above those where
discontinuities occur, but below those where planing and other
presently-neglected flow phenomena might be important. This range
(say 8-10-13 knots for a 1-tonne vessel) is also the competition range
for some sporting applications.
<p>
Plotting trimaran results versus the displacement ratio sigma has the
feature that the monohull results are reproduced when sigma=0 and the
catamaran results when sigma=1, which is a useful check. The
trimaran thus interpolates between monohulls and catamarans, for
0&lt;sigma&lt;1.

Figure 6(a) gives the residual total drag as a function of sigma and
shows that trimarans are never competitive with the best monohull. As
sigma increases from the monohull value of 0, the drag rises to a
maximum at about sigma=0.8 before falling again toward the catamaran
limit at sigma=1, which (as already discussed) is inferior to the
monohull, and also to any trimaran with sigma less than about 0.2.

Figures 6(c) and 6(d) give the optimum lateral and longitudinal offsets
of the wing hulls. The lateral offset b would approach W/2 in the
catamaran limit sigma=1, where W is as before the lateral separation of
the catamaran demihulls. However, in the speed range being examined, the
optimum value of W for a catamaran is actually infinite. Thus as sigma
increases from the monohull value of zero, the lateral offset remains
relatively small at less than 4 metres until sigma exceeds about 0.8,
then rises rapidly as the trimaran turns into a catamaran.
<p>
The optimum longitudinal offset a given in Figure 6(d) displays a somewhat
complicated variation with sigma. The limiting value at the monohull end
sigma=0 seems to be about one-half of the main hull length, and since the
wing hull lengths are tending to zero in this limit with zero lateral
separation, the wing hulls simply &quot;tuck in&quot; at the stern of the
main hull. At the other extreme, in the catamaran limit sigma=1, there
is again a tendency for a to increase rapidly but of course the
&quot;main&quot; hull then becomes a hydrodynamically insignificant
&quot;dagger board&quot; far ahead of the dominating wing hulls.
<p>
The isosceles triangle formed by the centres of the three hulls of the
trimaran has a half-angle that is quite small for near-monohull cases
with sigma&lt;0.3, but tends to range between 10 and 15 degrees for larger
sigma. This is consistent with estimates of the optimum half angle for
minimum wave resistance (references?), noting that it implies that the
wing hulls lie just inside the Kelvin angle of the wave pattern of the
main hull.

Figure 6(e) gives the overall length of the trimaran. This is the sum of
the main and wing hull half-lengths, plus the longitudinal separation a.
For near-monohulls, because the wing hulls are short and the longitudinal
separation a is less than half the main hull length, the overall length is
close to that of the monohull, decreasing slightly as sigma increases from
zero. For the lower speeds, the overall length reaches a minimum of about
10% less than the monohull length at about sigma=0.5-0.6; there is a more
complicated variation at the higher speed. The overall length becomes large
as the trimaran approaches a catamaran, but loses meaning as the
&quot;main&quot; hull becomes of vanishing size and significance relative
to the wing hulls.
