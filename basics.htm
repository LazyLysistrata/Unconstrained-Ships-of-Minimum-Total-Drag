<h2>2. BASIC CONSIDERATIONS</h2>

<h3>2.1 Hull geometry</h3>

In this study, we present results for one hullform only - a canoe body
defined by parabolic waterlines, elliptical cross-sections, and a
parabolic keel line. Although this form is an obvious idealisation, there
has recently been an appeal (Insel and Molland 1991) for further work on
similar hull shapes.
<p>
For this hullform, the block coefficient is C<sub>b</sub> = 0.417 and the
prismatic coefficient is C<sub>p</sub> = 4 C<sub>b</sub>/pi = 0.533.
Clearly this is a much finer type of hull than that of a typical merchant
ship, but is relevant to sporting canoes and hulls of special high-speed
vessels. It is particularly appropriate for slender vessels with the high
length/beam ratios that we shall find optimal.
<p>

<h3>2.2 Wave Resistance</h3>

We use Michell's integral (Michell 1898; see also Tuck 1989) to estimate
the wave resistance R<sub>w</sub> of the ship. This requires evaluation of
a triple integral, one integral in each of the length-wise and draft-wise
co-ordinate directions, and one integral with respect to the angle theta of
propagation of the ship-generated waves. The numerical method used here for
evaluating these integrals both for monohulls and catamarans is described
fully in Tuck (1987). For monohulls, we use up to 81 stations, 81
waterlines, and 640 intervals for the integration with respect to theta.
This is an unusually high degree of precision, and is sufficient to
eliminate any numerical artefacts in the integration, which is a common
source of error in use of Michell's integral. For multihulls we sometimes
need an even larger number of intervals of theta, because the interference
between the wave patterns produced by the individual hulls tends to produce
a more oscillatory variation in the wave spectrum with propagation
direction than for monohulls.
<p>
Michell's integral depends for its validity on the ship being thin, and is
sometimes considered (perhaps unfairly) to be insufficiently accurate for
use with ships of conventional proportions. However, the hulls produced by
the optimisation process in this study are significantly thinner than
conventional ships, and there is good evidence that for such slender
vessels Michell's integral is satisfactory. For example, Hanhirova et al
1995 (see also Tuck 1989 and Chapman 1972) report that for
length-based Froude numbers above 0.35, accuracies relative to measured
residuary resistance of better than 10% are achieved by Michell's
integral for hulls with length/beam ratios of the order of 10.0. The
optimised hulls in the present study are even more slender.
<p>
In any case, the hulls resulting from the optimisation process also have
the property that their wave resistance is generally only about 10% of the
total, so that the absolute accuracy of the wave resistance measure is not
critical. This proportion of wave resistance to total drag is lower than
what is usually encountered with conventional ships, since the present
optimum is in part achieved by increasing the length beyond the
conventional, so as to reduce the influence of wave resistance. Even though
the wave resistance is then only a small component of the final total drag,
it remains a critically important component nevertheless in controlling the
optimisation process; after all, if there was no wave resistance at all,
short ships of minimum surface area would be preferred.
<p>
There is really no actual Michell integral for multihulls. What we use here
is the assumption that each separate hull can be represented by the same
singularity distribution (namely sources distributed over its own
centreplane) as if that hull were alone. This neglects one type of
interaction between the hulls, namely the influence of one hull on
another in creating a cross-flow which modifies this singularity
distribution, in particular inducing vortices as well as sources. On the
other hand, it does not prevent interference between the wave systems
generated by the centreplane sources. Little is known of the relative
importance of these two types of interactions, but the present assumption
seems to yield quite good results for the wave resistance (Tuck 1987,
Salvesen et al 1985). It is notable that the assumption that there are no
induced vortices due to other hulls can be exactly satisfied by allowing
the hull centrelines to possess a suitable small camber (Lin 1974). This
camber has no effect on the wave resistance, and may be desirable in
eliminating induced drag. It is also important (Tuck 1987, Newman and
Tuck 19xx) that the size of this induced-crossflow effect relative to
that due to the hull's own thickness is proportional to the draft/length
ratio, and hence negligible for conventional (and <I>a forteriori</I> the
present optimal) slender ships of small draft, even if formally of the
same order as self-thickness effects for the thin ships of finite draft for
which Michell derived his integral.

<h3>2.3 Viscous Resistance</h3>

The viscous resistance R<sub>v</sub> can be written as
<p>
R<sub>v</sub>=1/2*rho*U<SUP>2</SUP>*S*C<sub>v</sub>
<p>
where rho is the water density and S the wetted surface area of the hull.
When skin friction dominates, the drag coefficient C<sub>v</sub> approximately
equals C<sub>f</sub>, where C<sub>f</sub> is a skin friction coefficient which
can be estimated using the ITTC 1957 ship correlation line (Proc. 8th ITTC).
<p>
C<sub>f</sub> = 0.075/(log<sub>10</sub>R-2)<SUP>2</SUP>
<p>
where R = UL/nu is the Reynolds number; nu approx equals
1.054 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP>m<SUP>2</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP> is the kinematic viscosity.
<p>
We have used the full length of the waterline for L in the definition of the
Reynolds number; however there are other possibilities. Gerritsma et al.
(1981) use 0.7L in their study of the resistance of a systematic yacht
hull series, reasoning that this defines a kind of average length.
<p>
<h3>2.4 Form Effects</h3>
As a correlation line, the ITTC 1957 line already contains some allowance
for three-dimensional effects, and two recent ITTC Committees have
recommended that additional corrections not be made in routine resistance
predictions of high speed craft (Insel and Molland 1991, p. 16). However,
including a form factor specific to the hullform under consideration can often
give better estimates of the viscous drag. This factor is difficult to estimate
and may vary with speed because of (among other things) changes in trim and
sinkage.
<p>
In their examination of eight-oared rowing shells, which have a hullform not
unlike the canoe body examined here, Scragg and Nelson (1991) found a simple
empirical formula for the form factor of these hulls. The viscous resistance
coefficient is written as
<p>
C<sub>v</sub> = (1+k)C<sub>f</sub>
<p>
where
<p>
k = 0.0097(theta<sub>entry</sub> + theta<sub>exit</sub>)
<p>
Here, theta<sub>entry</sub> and theta<sub>exit</sub> are the half-angles
(in degrees) of the bow and stern, respectively, at the waterplane.
<p>
Care must be taken in applying this form factor. In an optimisation
problem where shape is not constrained, there could be many undesirable
side-effects. For example, since there is a tendency of the optimisation
to reduce the above half-angles, bows could tend to be overly cuspy. In
addition, since more of the displacement can be placed deeper without
penalty, there could be a tendency away from wall-sided hulls and towards
some tumblehome below the waterline. This is not an issue here, since our
parabolic waterlines and elliptic sections do not allow so much freedom. We
shall also find that use of this form factor leads to an improved
optimisation process in the high-speed range.
<p>

<h3>2.5 Some Effects Neglected</h3>

Wave-breaking and spray resistance is neglected. Wave-breaking resistance
for our fine, sharp-bowed hulls, would be negligible at relatively low
speeds. Spray resistance seems to be one of the reasons form factors are
difficult to calculate at high speeds.
<p>
We assume that there is no effect of dynamic vertical forces, which at
low speeds account for sinkage and trim. These are small effects, but
notably for multihulls can be substantially different than for monohulls.
At high speeds, dynamic forces are upward and yield a lift rather than a
sinkage; hence planing, and we neglect that. The present results are for
displacement rather than planing conditions, although for completeness
we exhibit them even in speed ranges where planing would be expected.
<p>
Asymmetric flow around each demihull of a catamaran has been observed.
This manifests itself in differences in draft and wetted surface area
between both sides of the demihulls. Asymmetrical flow can cause lift
and inevitably, induced drag; see Insel and Molland (1991).
<p>
Viscous interference between the demihulls of catamarans also seems to be
an as yet incompletely understood effect, which can complicate the
estimation and application of simple form factors. Insel and Molland
(1991) state that &quot;catamarans show substantially higher resistance
than twice that of the monohulls, even at ... low speeds where wave
interactions are negligible, therefore indicating viscous interactions.
Additionally, flow visualisation experiments ... on a catamaran model
indicated a change of flow lines and pressure field, hence some form of
viscous interaction.&quot;
<p>
Shallow water effects can be important in some applications, e.g. see
Millward (1992) for catamarans, and Scragg and Nelson (1993) for rowing
shells. However, we retain the infinite-depth assumption here. We also
neglect any lateral flow domain restrictions; see Doctors and Day (1995)
and Day and Doctors (1996) for the case of a ship moving in a channel.
